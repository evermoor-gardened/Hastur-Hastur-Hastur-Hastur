# Changelog

All notable changes to RUINWARE SOVEREIGN ENGINE are documented here.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-02-18 — FINAL SYNTHESIS

### The Grand Unification
- Merged ProvidenceOS Kernel, Cenobite Logic, and Cogitator AI into single `RuinWareEngine` class
- Complete GUI implementation with color-coded subsystem routing
- Threaded AI processing to keep interface responsive during Ollama calls

### Added
- `RuinWareEngine` — unified orchestrator with automatic input routing
- `RuinWareGUI` — tkinter dark terminal interface with tagged output streams
- `WitnessBaseline` — 144-point golden-ratio-weighted consciousness substrate computation
- `LamentConfiguration` — pi-sequence puzzle-state machine with full solve path
- `CenobiteEngine` — labyrinth navigation with layer descent
- Cogitator bridge to Ollama with configurable model and system prompt
- `/status` command for kernel diagnostics (uptime, witness depth, puzzle state)
- Graceful degradation when `requests` or `tkinter` unavailable
- Background threading for AI calls

### Architecture
- Three-tier input routing: Cenobite → System → Cogitator
- No external service dependencies for core functionality
- All state held locally, no telemetry, no cloud calls except optional Ollama

## [2.0.0] — 2026-02-01 — LEVIATHAN

### Added
- Lament Configuration puzzle engine
- Cenobite layer navigation system
- Pi-sequence gating mechanism

## [1.0.0] — 2026-01-20 — LE SOMMEIL

### Added
- ProvidenceOS Kernel initial implementation
- Witness Baseline computation
- Golden ratio layer weighting
- Universal constants framework
